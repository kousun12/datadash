This visualization creates a heatmap to show the density of taxi trips between different locations in New York City, focusing on the top 100 most frequent routes. This approach provides a clear and concise view of the busiest taxi routes in the city.

Key aspects of the visualization:

1. Data preparation:
   - Use the PULocationID (pickup location) and DOLocationID (dropoff location) columns.
   - Count the number of trips between each unique pair of pickup and dropoff locations.
   - Select only the top 100 routes by trip count.

2. Visualization:
   - Create a compact heatmap where both axes represent location IDs involved in the top 100 routes.
   - The x-axis represents pickup locations (PULocationID).
   - The y-axis represents dropoff locations (DOLocationID).
   - Each cell in the heatmap is colored based on the number of trips between those two locations.
   - Use a logarithmic color scale from light yellow (fewer trips) to dark red (many trips).

3. Additional features:
   - Include a color legend to show the relationship between colors and trip counts.
   - Display the exact number of trips in each cell.
   - Add tooltips that show detailed information when hovering over a cell.

This heatmap allows viewers to quickly identify:
- The most popular routes among the top 100 (darkest cells)
- Locations that are common for pickups or dropoffs (frequently appearing IDs on axes)
- Patterns in taxi movement across the busiest routes

This visualization is effective because:
1. It focuses on the most significant routes, reducing clutter and information overload.
2. It provides a clear view of the spatial relationships in the most frequent taxi trips.
3. It's intuitive to understand, even for those not familiar with the specific location IDs.
4. It reveals patterns in the busiest routes that might not be apparent in tabular data.

The use of Observable Plot with Plot.cell() creates an interactive and visually appealing heatmap that effectively communicates the patterns in New York City's busiest taxi routes.
