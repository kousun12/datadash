This visualization allows readers to:
- Observe trends in total agricultural value over time
- Compare the relative contributions of different commodity types
- Identify any significant changes or shifts in the composition of agricultural production
- Access detailed information through tooltips

The stacked area chart is particularly suitable for this data because it effectively shows how different categories (commodity types) contribute to a whole over time, providing a comprehensive view of agricultural trends.
