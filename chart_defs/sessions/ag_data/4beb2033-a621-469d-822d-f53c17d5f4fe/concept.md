Based on the information provided about the "ag_data" table, I would suggest creating a stacked area chart to visualize the data over time for different commodities. This presentation would be particularly useful for showing trends and comparisons across multiple years and commodities.

Here's how it would work:

1. X-axis: Marketing/calendar year
   This would show the progression of time, allowing viewers to see trends over the years.

2. Y-axis: Value text
   This represents the numerical data for each attribute.

3. Color: Commodity
   Different colors would represent different commodities, allowing for easy comparison.

4. Stacked areas: Attribute
   For each commodity, we'd stack different attributes (like Beginning stocks, Production, etc.) to show how they contribute to the total for that commodity.

5. Facets: Commodity Type
   We could create two separate charts side by side, one for "Crops" and one for "Livestock/Dairy".

6. Interactivity: Hover tooltips
   When a user hovers over an area, they could see details like the exact value, unit, and any available summary information.

This visualization would allow readers to:
- See trends over time for each commodity
- Compare different commodities easily
- Understand the composition of each commodity's total (through the stacked attributes)
- Distinguish between crops and livestock/dairy data
- Access detailed information through tooltips

The stacked area chart is particularly suitable for this data because it can handle time series data, multiple categories (commodities), and sub-categories (attributes) simultaneously, providing a comprehensive view of the agricultural data trends.
