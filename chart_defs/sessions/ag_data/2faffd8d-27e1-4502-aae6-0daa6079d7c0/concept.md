Based on the information provided about the "ag_data" table, I would suggest creating an interactive time series chart for visualizing the data. Here's how it could work:

1. Main Chart:
   - X-axis: Marketing/calendar year
   - Y-axis: Value text (which appears to be numeric data)
   - Lines: Each line represents a unique combination of Commodity and Attribute

2. Interactive Features:
   - Dropdown menus to select:
     a) Commodity Type (Crops or Livestock/Dairy)
     b) Specific Commodity
     c) Attribute
   - When selections are made, the chart updates to show the relevant time series.

3. Additional Information:
   - Hover tooltips that display:
     a) Exact value for each data point
     b) Unit of measurement
     c) Source of the data
   - A sidebar or expandable section showing the "Commodity summary" and "Attribute summary" (when available) for the selected data.

4. Color Coding:
   - Use different colors for Crops vs Livestock/Dairy data
   - Use different line styles or markers for different attributes within a commodity

5. Y-axis Scaling:
   - Implement dynamic y-axis scaling that adjusts based on the selected data to ensure good visibility of trends

This visualization would allow users to easily compare trends over time for different commodities and attributes, while also providing access to detailed information through interactive elements. It accommodates the time-series nature of the data and allows for easy comparison across different commodities and attributes.
