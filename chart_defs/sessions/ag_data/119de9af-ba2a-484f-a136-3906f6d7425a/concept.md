To address the "No valid data points after filtering" error and simplify the chart, we propose the following streamlined approach:

1. Simplified Data Handling:
   - Focus on handling standard JavaScript array inputs to reduce complexity.
   - Implement basic data validation to ensure essential fields are present and valid.

2. Minimal Data Filtering:
   - Simplify the filtering process in both SQL and JavaScript to retain more data points.
   - Log any filtered-out data points for easier debugging.

3. Basic Error Handling:
   - Implement straightforward error messages for common issues like missing or invalid data.
   - Provide a simple fallback visualization or message when no valid data is available.

4. Core Chart Features:
   - X-axis: Marketing/calendar year
   - Y-axis: Value text (with basic type conversion)
   - Single line chart for all commodities combined
   - Basic color coding for different commodity types
   - Simple tooltips on hover

5. Simplified Visualization:
   - Remove complex features like interactive legends, dropdown filters, and zoom/pan functionality.
   - Focus on rendering a basic, readable chart with the available data.

6. User Feedback:
   - Display clear, concise error messages when data issues occur.
   - Provide basic information about the data being displayed or any filtering applied.

7. Performance Considerations:
   - Optimize for smaller datasets to ensure quick rendering and responsiveness.

8. Documentation:
   - Clearly specify the expected data format and structure.
   - Provide simple examples of how to prepare and pass data to the chart function.

This simplified approach aims to create a more robust and easier-to-maintain visualization that focuses on displaying the core data effectively, while gracefully handling potential data issues.
