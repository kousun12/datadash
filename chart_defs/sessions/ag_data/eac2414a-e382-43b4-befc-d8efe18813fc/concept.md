Based on the information provided about the "ag_data" table, we have created an interactive time series chart to visually present this data. Here's how it works:

1. Chart Type: Line chart with dots

2. X-axis: Marketing/calendar year
   This allows us to see trends over time.

3. Y-axis: Value (Million bushels)
   This represents the numerical data for beginning stocks.

4. Color-coded lines and dots: Each line and set of dots represents a different Commodity

5. Interactive elements:
   - Hover tooltips showing detailed information for each data point
   - The chart is responsive and adjusts to the width of the container

6. Legend: To identify which color corresponds to which commodity

7. Tooltips: When hovering over a dot, a tooltip appears showing:
   - Commodity name
   - Year
   - Value (in million bushels)

This visualization allows users to:
- Compare beginning stock trends across different crop commodities over time
- See detailed information for specific years by hovering over data points
- Easily identify peak years or significant changes for each commodity

The addition of tooltips enhances the user experience by providing precise data for each point without cluttering the chart. This approach provides a clear and interactive way to explore the agricultural data, allowing users to identify trends and make comparisons across different crops and years.
