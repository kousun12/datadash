Based on the information provided about the "ag_data" table, I would suggest creating an interactive time series chart to visually present this data. Here's how it could work:

1. Chart Type: Line chart

2. X-axis: Marketing/calendar year
   This allows us to see trends over time.

3. Y-axis: Value text
   This represents the numerical data for each attribute.

4. Color-coded lines: Each line represents a different Commodity

5. Interactive elements:
   - Dropdown menus to select:
     a) Commodity Type (Crops or Livestock/Dairy)
     b) Attribute (e.g., Beginning stocks, Production, etc.)
     c) Unit (e.g., Million bushels, Million pounds)
   - Hover tooltips showing detailed information for each data point
   - Ability to zoom in/out on specific time ranges

6. Legend: To identify which color corresponds to which commodity

This visualization would allow users to:
- Compare trends across different commodities over time
- Easily switch between different attributes and units of measurement
- Focus on either crops or livestock/dairy
- See detailed information for specific years by hovering over data points

This approach provides a comprehensive yet flexible way to explore the agricultural data, allowing users to identify trends, make comparisons, and drill down into specific areas of interest.
