Based on the information provided about the "ag_data" table, we have created an interactive stacked area chart to visually present this data. Here's how it works:

1. Chart Type: Stacked Area Chart

2. X-axis: Marketing/calendar year
   This allows us to see trends over time.
   - Tick labels are rotated 45 degrees for better readability
   - Additional bottom margin is added to prevent label overlap

3. Y-axis: Value (Million bushels)
   This represents the cumulative numerical data for beginning stocks across all commodities.

4. Color-coded areas: Each stacked area represents a different Commodity

5. Interactive elements:
   - Hover tooltips showing detailed information for each data point
   - The chart is responsive and adjusts to the width of the container

6. Legend: To identify which color corresponds to which commodity

7. Tooltips: When hovering over an area, a tooltip appears showing:
   - Commodity name
   - Year
   - Value (in million bushels)

8. Layout improvements:
   - Increased bottom margin to accommodate rotated x-axis labels
   - Adjusted overall chart height to maintain proportions

This visualization allows users to:
- See the total beginning stocks across all commodities for each year
- Compare the relative contribution of each commodity to the total stocks
- Observe how the composition of beginning stocks changes over time
- Identify years with particularly high or low total stocks
- Clearly read all x-axis labels without overlap

The stacked area chart resolves the issue of overlapping lines at the bottom of the previous chart. It provides a clear view of both individual commodity trends and the overall trend in beginning stocks. The stacked nature of the chart makes it easy to see which commodities contribute more or less to the total stocks in any given year.

The addition of tooltips enhances the user experience by providing precise data for each point without cluttering the chart. However, there is currently an issue with the y position of the hover tooltip not following the y value of the curve. This means that the tooltip may appear at a fixed vertical position regardless of where on the stacked area the user is hovering, which could lead to some confusion when trying to read values for specific commodities within the stack.

The improved layout ensures all information is clearly visible and legible. This approach provides a clear and interactive way to explore the agricultural data, allowing users to identify trends and make comparisons across different crops and years, while also giving a sense of the total beginning stocks for all commodities combined.

Future improvements should focus on fixing the tooltip positioning to accurately reflect the y-value of the specific point being hovered over within the stacked area chart. This will greatly enhance the precision and usability of the interactive features.

Update: An error has been identified in the chart configuration. The "unknown offset: zero" error suggests that the stacking functionality is not working as intended. This issue needs to be addressed in the chart's JavaScript code to ensure proper stacking and accurate data representation.
