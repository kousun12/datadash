Based on the provided table structure and sample data, I would suggest creating an interactive line chart with the following features:

1. X-axis: Marketing/calendar year
2. Y-axis: Value text (the numerical data)
3. Multiple lines: Each line represents a different Commodity
4. Color coding: Lines are color-coded based on Commodity Type (Crops vs. Livestock/Dairy)
5. Interactive legend: Allows users to toggle visibility of specific commodities
6. Hover tooltips: Displays detailed information when hovering over data points

Here's how it would work:

1. The chart would initially display all commodities over time, showing trends in their respective values.

2. Users can use the interactive legend to select or deselect specific commodities, allowing for focused comparison.

3. Hovering over any data point would display a tooltip with detailed information, including:
   - Commodity
   - Commodity Type
   - Attribute
   - Unit
   - Exact value
   - Source

4. A dropdown menu would allow users to switch between different Attributes (e.g., Beginning stocks, Production, etc.), updating the chart accordingly.

5. Another dropdown would let users change the Unit of measurement, recalculating and redrawing the chart as needed.

This visualization would allow users to easily compare trends across different commodities and commodity types over time, while also providing access to detailed information on demand. The interactivity would make it possible to focus on specific areas of interest within the large dataset.
